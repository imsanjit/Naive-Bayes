# Naive-Bayes
Naive Bayes Classifier


##### Assumption: Data is not corelated to each other.

- Naive bayes is completely depends on PDF(Probability Density Function)
- Naive Bayes is based on Bayes' theorem.

### Theorem:

P(A|B) = {P(B|A) * P(A) } / P(B)


- P(A|B) --> Probability of A given that B is true. (Likelyhood)
- P(B|A) --> Probability of B given that A is true.
- P(A) --> Probability of A.
- P(B) --> Probability of B.
